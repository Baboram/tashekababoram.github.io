											<li><h3>Time Management</h3></li>
												<p> I have the ability to manage my time effectively for any endeavor I am assigned is one of my greatest strengths.
													 Despite the limited amount of time, I frequently beat deadlines.I have learned this skill by categorizing my 
													tasks according to urgency, then setting deadlines to guarantee that each activity is accomplished.
												</p>
											<li><h3>Problem-Solving </h3></li>
												<p> I am an efficient and problem-solving individual.
												 	I constantly consider the most effective and practical solution to a problem.
													When I encounter a problem, I first analyze the best, medium-best, and worst-case
												 scenarios before pursuing the course of action that will have the minimum consequences.
												</p>
											<li><h3>Adaptable</h3></li>
												<p> Finally, I am an adaptable person who can swiftly adapt to changes in any circumstance. 
													As I am open-minded to new ideas, I believe this gives me the potential to thrive.
													I have improved this ability by embracing the cliché "it is what it is." 
													Accepting changes for what they are has made life easier.

											<p>

												The Twelve Pillars book is an educational read that can inspire one to improve oneself
												 and live up to their greatest potential. The book's four chapters are organized as follows:
												 Achieve your goals, where it is discussed the value of writing down goals for short, medium, or long-time frames.
												 I believe this is a good place to start in terms of motivating me to identify my goals and then devote effort into
												 achieving them.
												<br/><br/>
												How to effectively use time and whom to spend it with formed another foundation of the book. There are many profound 
												life lessons in this book. It emphasizes the importance of always working to improve oneself and surrounding oneself
												 with positive influences. The book urges me to reassess my relationships and consider whether they have influenced me 
												in a positive or negative way. It also urges me to restrict my association with people who are not propelling me forward.
												<br/><br/>
												Finally, the chapter Life-long learner discusses the need of always educating oneself by reading. Through literature,
												 I may constantly explore different ways of thinking and add new knowledge that might influence my perspective.
